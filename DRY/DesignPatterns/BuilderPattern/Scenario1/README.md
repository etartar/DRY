The builder pattern is useful when there is a class that the complexity is high, for example, 
a class that has the properties setter private and to build them you need to pass many parameters in the constructor 
that you want to use, imagine this class has many constructors where each constructor has their logic, 
build the class of the different way.

This pattern helps us because all complexity stays inside one class and 
this class will have only one responsibility, create the class.
